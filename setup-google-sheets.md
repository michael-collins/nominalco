## Step 1: Create Your Google Sheet

1. **Create New Sheet**: Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com) → New Blank Sheet
2. **Name it**: "Nominalco Portfolio Projects"
3. **Set up columns** (exact spelling matters):

| Column | Description | Example |

| **title** | Project name | "E-commerce Mobile App" |

## Step 2: Easy Image Hosting Options

### 🥇 **Google Drive (Recommended - Free & Easy)**

**Setup Process:**
1. Create folder: "Nominalco Portfolio Images"
2. Upload your images
3. **Right-click image** → Share → Change to "Anyone with the link"
4. Copy the shareable link
5. Paste into your Google Sheet (the code will auto-convert it!)

**Why Google Drive:**
- ✅ Free 15GB storage
- ✅ Auto-converts URLs for you
- ✅ Same Google account
- ✅ Easy team access
- ✅ Built-in backup

### 🥈 **Imgur (Super Simple)**
1. Go to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com)
2. Drag & drop images
3. Copy direct link
4. Paste in sheet

### 🥉 **Other Options:**
- **Cloudinary**: Free 25GB, great for optimization
- **Dropbox**: Free 2GB (auto-converts URLs)
- **GitHub**: If you're comfortable with git

# 🚀 Direct Google Sheets Setup (No Third-Party Services!)

## Step 1: Create Your Google Sheet

1. **Create New Sheet**: Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com) → New Blank Sheet
2. **Import the CSV**: 
   - File → Import → Upload
   - Select `nominalco-portfolio-template.csv`
   - Choose "Replace spreadsheet"
3. **Make it Public**:
   - Click "Share" → "Change to anyone with the link"
   - Set to "Viewer" (this is safe - only viewing, not editing)

## Step 2: Get Your Sheet ID

1. **Copy the URL** from your address bar
2. **Extract the Sheet ID** - it's the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE/edit
   ```

## Step 3: Update Your Website Code

1. **Open** `/workspaces/nominalco/script.js`
2. **Find this line** (around line 17):
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_ID = '10Ze__9S_rwj_HWnJEMH-pArREc_XheP5NCJNohJVtkc';
   ```
3. **Replace** with your actual Sheet ID:
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE';
   ```

## Step 4: Sheet Name (if needed)

If your Google Sheet tab is named something other than "Sheet1":

1. **Find this line**:
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_NAME = 'Sheet1';
   ```
2. **Change** to your actual sheet name:
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_NAME = 'Portfolio'; // or whatever you named it
   ```

## ✨ Benefits of Direct Connection:

- ✅ **No Third-Party Services**: Direct connection to Google Sheets
- ✅ **100% Free**: No external service fees or limits
- ✅ **More Reliable**: One less service that could break
- ✅ **Faster Updates**: Changes appear immediately
- ✅ **Better Privacy**: Your data stays with Google only
- ✅ **No Setup Complexity**: Just share the sheet and update one ID

## 🔧 How It Works:

Google Sheets has a built-in CSV export feature. The code:
1. **Fetches** your sheet as CSV directly from Google
2. **Parses** the CSV data automatically
3. **Converts** it to the format your website needs
4. **Handles** all the image URL processing and formatting

## 📊 Managing Your Content:

### **Adding Projects:**
1. **Add a new row** to your Google Sheet
2. **Fill in the columns** following the existing format
3. **Save** (auto-saves) - changes appear on website instantly!

### **Image Hosting (unchanged):**
- **Google Drive**: Upload → Share → Paste URL (auto-converts)
- **Imgur**: Drag & drop → Copy direct link
- **Any public image URL** works

### **Column Structure:**
- `id` - Sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...)
- `title` - Project name
- `description` - Short description for grid
- `image` - Main project image URL
- `tags` - Comma-separated (Mobile,Hardware,Design)
- `detailImages` - Multiple URLs separated by commas
- `longDescription` - Full project description

## 🎯 Pro Tips:

### **Sheet Organization:**
- Keep the first row as headers
- Don't delete the header row
- Add projects as new rows
- Use consistent ID numbering

### **Troubleshooting:**
- Sheet must be "Anyone with link can view"
- Sheet ID must be exact (no extra characters)
- Column names must match exactly
- Check browser console for error messages

## 🚨 Security Note:

Making your sheet public for viewing is safe because:
- ✅ **Read-only access** - nobody can edit your content
- ✅ **No personal info** - only contains project information you want to showcase
- ✅ **Easy to revoke** - you can make it private anytime
- ✅ **Standard practice** - many portfolios work this way

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your portfolio now updates directly from Google Sheets with zero third-party dependencies. Just edit your sheet and watch the changes appear on your website instantly!
